Various resources for CS education that I've written.

* **Web Scraping**, 2 part tutorial series. Covers inspecting web pages, downloading HTML data from server, extracting information using BeautifulSoup and HTML tags, and parsing HTML and other types of data. Written for Caltech's CS42 (CS Education) course and reworked.
* **Linked Lists**, 1 page summary sheet. Gives a high level explanation of what linked lists are (+ diagram), what their main use cases and tradeoffs are, some useful modifications that can be made, and some of the relevant applications they are and can be used for.
